            { fact: "Vocalizations", description: "Cheetahs communicate with a variety of sounds, including purrs, chirps, growls, and hisses, but they cannot roar like other big cats." },
            { fact: "Habitat", description: "They are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with small populations in Iran. They prefer open savannahs and grasslands where they can use their speed to hunt." },
